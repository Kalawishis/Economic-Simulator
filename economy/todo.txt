IT APPEARS THAT SINCE YOU PUT GAME_THEORY INTO THE PATH, YOU CANNOT SHARE ANY MODULE NAMES
IN THIS FOLDER WITH NAMES IN GAME_THEORY, SINCE GAME_THEORY WILL IMPORT OUTSIDE ITSELF

FIND A BETTER WAY TO FORCE CONSUMER TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION OF A CERTAIN GOOD IF 
OVERSUPPLY THAN JUST BAITING THEM WITH AN INFINITY PAYOFF

COME UP WITH A SYSTEM TO TWEAK THE FACTORS OF PRODUCERS IN A MARKET WHEN DECISION
IS BEING CHANGED, AND MAYBE EVEN IMPLEMENT A PRICE CHANGING SYSTEM

FIND A WAY TO GET RID OF ILLEGAL (NEGATIVE INFINITY) STRATEGIES TO OPTIMIZE MARKET

CONSIDER REPLACING INIFNITY WITH MANDATORY

get working on competition and interactions between consumers and producers
you are on the beginning of chapter 9


hypothetical_1:

budget: $1.5
good 1: utility 5, price, $1, utility/price = 5
good 2: utility 6, price, $1.5, utility/price = 4

hypothetical_2:

good 1: utility 5, price, $1, utility/price = 5
good 2: utility 6, price, $2, utility/price = 3

these hypotheticals show that you're going to have to include some sequential_game system in 
Consumer and Producer (and Market?) if you want them to be intelligent and solve problems 
like this. more layers of recursion, or more game layers, could mean a higher intelligence
