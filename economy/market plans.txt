consumer utility function: x
producer production function: sqrt(f)

consumer demand function: i/p
d(i, g) = i/g where i is budget and g is the good price

2 consumers, so total demand function is 2i/g

producer purchase function: purchases until (additional production * p) = cost of f
in other words, when 1/(2*sqrt(x))*g = l
p(l, g) = ? where l is the price of the factor and g is the good price
p(l, g) = g^2/(4*l^2)

producer production function is sqrt(g^2/(4*l^2))

2 producers, so total production function is 2*sqrt(g^2/(4*l^2))

according to wolfram alpha that is sqrt(g^2/l^2)
when l is 1 total production is just g
